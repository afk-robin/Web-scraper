# Web-scraper
This Python script scrapes Premier League top scorer stats from BBC Sport and displays them in a table.
<br>
This Python script scrapes the Premier League Top Scorers data from the BBC Sport website using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.
<br>
It collects key statistics such as player names, team names, goals scored, assists, matches played, and shots taken, and stores them in a structured pandas DataFrame.<br>
The user is prompted to enter how many top playersâ€™ data they want to display, and the script then prints out that subset of the data.
<br>
This project is useful for quick analysis or integration into larger football analytics workflows.
<br>
Note that the script depends on the HTML structure of the BBC Sport webpage, so updates may be needed if the website layout changes.
